-- __These do not block, and so none of them returns a value.__
--
-- Under X11 this module grabbed the keyboard and sat in @maskEvent@ until a
-- modifier came up, which is what let it hand back an accumulated result and a
-- final state.  That is not merely awkward here, it is impossible: a binding
-- may only be created during a manage sequence and cannot fire until that
-- sequence has finished, so waiting inside one would be waiting for something
-- the compositor is not permitted to send.  The keys are captured, the call
-- returns, and the handler runs as they arrive.
--
-- Two things follow, and both are visible:
--
-- * Every function here returns @X ()@ where it used to return @X b@ or
--   @X (a, s)@.  No caller in xmonad-contrib used those values -- they were
--   @void@ed or discarded -- which is why the names survive at all.
--
-- * __Anything sequenced after a call runs before the keys are pressed.__ A
--   caller that cleans up afterwards has to do it in the handler instead;
--   "XMonad.Actions.MostRecentlyUsed" is the worked example, where the flag
--   guarding against re-entry is cleared on conclusion rather than on the next
--   line.
--
-- The mechanism is @river_xkb_bindings_seat_v1.modifiers_watch@, which reports
-- a change in the modifiers the window manager asked about and is exactly the
-- "and now it has been let go" signal this needs.  It arrived in version 3; on
-- anything older the handler is never installed and the action runs once.
-- 'XMonad.River.whileModifiersHeld' says so on stderr when that happens.

-- | An action that temporarily usurps and responds to key press/release
--   events, concluding when one of the modifier keys is released.

-- than the key that changed it, so the keysyms have to be turned into the mask
-- @modifiers_watch@ takes.  An unrecognised keysym contributes nothing, which
