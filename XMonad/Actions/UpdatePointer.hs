-- the idea of switching focus as the mouse crosses window boundaries to
-- keep the mouse near the currently focused window

-- $usage
-- You can use this module with the following in your @xmonad.hs@:
--
-- > import XMonad
-- > import XMonad.Actions.UpdatePointer
--
-- Enable it by including it in your logHook definition, e.g.:
--
-- > logHook = updatePointer (0.5, 0.5) (1, 1)
--
-- which will move the pointer to the nearest point of a newly focused
-- window. The first argument establishes a reference point within the
-- newly-focused window, while the second argument linearly interpolates
-- between said reference point and the edges of the newly-focused window to
-- obtain a bounding box for the pointer.
--
-- > logHook = updatePointer (0.5, 0.5) (0, 0) -- exact centre of window
-- > logHook = updatePointer (0.25, 0.25) (0.25, 0.25) -- near the top-left
-- > logHook = updatePointer (0.5, 0.5) (1.1, 1.1) -- within 110% of the edge
--
-- To use this with an existing logHook, use >> :
--
-- > logHook = dynamicLog
-- >           >> updatePointer (1, 1) (0, 0)
--
-- which moves the pointer to the bottom-right corner of the focused window.

-- | Update the pointer's location to the currently focused
-- window or empty screen unless it's already there, or unless the user was changing
-- focus with the mouse
--
-- See also 'XMonad.Actions.UpdateFocus.focusUnderPointer' for an inverse
-- operation that updates the focus instead. The two can be combined in a
-- single config if neither goes into 'logHook' but are invoked explicitly in
-- individual key bindings.
--
-- The warp waits for the layout.  This is normally reached from a 'logHook',
-- which 'XMonad.Operations.windows' runs before the layout has been applied,
-- so asking where the focused window is would answer with where it was.  For
-- anything that moves a window rather than only the focus -- swapping two
-- windows, say -- that is the wrong rectangle, and the pointer is left behind
-- on the window that took the old position.  See 'XMonad.River.afterLayout'.
updatePointer :: (Rational, Rational) -> (Rational, Rational) -> X ()
updatePointer refPos ratio = do
  -- Both of these are read now rather than after the layout, because both say
  -- why this call is happening and neither survives the wait.  'mouseFocused'
  -- is scoped to the dynamic extent of 'XMonad.Operations.focus' by 'local',
  -- so once that has returned it reads 'False' whatever set it -- and the
  -- guard against fighting the user's own mouse would never fire.
