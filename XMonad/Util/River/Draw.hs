-- Module      :  XMonad.Util.River.Draw
-- Description :  Drawing on window-manager surfaces, over cairo and pango.
-- License     :  BSD-style (see xmonad/LICENSE)
--
-- The river replacement for the Xlib drawing that "XMonad.Util.Font" and
-- "XMonad.Util.XUtils" are built on.
--
-- Why this lives in xmonad-contrib rather than in xmonad itself: upstream
-- xmonad has no font or graphics-context code at all -- @Util.Font@,
-- @Decoration@ and @Prompt@ are all contrib's, and contrib already keeps its
-- X11 text dependency behind the @use_xft@ flag.  The river split is the same
-- one.  xmonad-river stops at @XMonad.River.Surface@, which hands out a
-- surface and a block of ARGB32 pixels; everything above that -- cairo, pango,
-- and the C libraries they bind -- is here, so a config with no prompts and no
-- decorations never links them.
--
-- The fit is unusually good.  A @wl_shm@ buffer is a caller-owned block of
-- premultiplied ARGB32, and that is precisely what
-- 'withImageSurfaceForData' wants, so cairo draws straight into the memory the
-- compositor will read.  There is no intermediate image and no format
-- conversion anywhere in the path.

-- | A resolved font, with its ascent and descent measured once.
--
-- Pango descriptions are cheap to build and immutable, so unlike an X11
-- @FontStruct@ there is nothing to open and nothing to release.  That is why
-- @releaseXMF@ has nothing to do under river.  The metrics are of the font
-- as a whole and never change, and every decoration asked for them on every
-- repaint.

-- | Parse a font description.
--
-- Accepts pango's own syntax (@\"Sans Bold 12\"@) and the two spellings
-- xmonad configs actually contain, because a config should not have to be
-- rewritten to move backends:
--
-- * @\"xft:Sans-12\"@ -- the Xft form, by far the most common in the wild.
--   The @xft:@ prefix is dropped and the final @-12@ read as a size.
--
-- * An X Logical Font Description, @\"-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-13-...\"@.
--   These name a bitmap font that does not exist under Wayland and cannot be
--   translated, so they fall back to a default of the same rough size.  A
--   silent fallback is right here: the alternative is a window manager that
--   refuses to start because a decoration asked for a font from 1987.

-- lays the text out and reports its extents without being asked to draw.
