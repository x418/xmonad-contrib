-- Module      :  XMonad.Util.River.Compat
-- Description :  The Xlib drawing vocabulary, over river surfaces and cairo.
-- License     :  BSD-style (see xmonad/LICENSE)
--
-- Enough of Xlib's drawing API to let "XMonad.Util.XUtils", "XMonad.Prompt",
-- "XMonad.Layout.Decoration" and their users keep the code they already have.
--
-- The names here are X11's on purpose, which is the opposite of the rule
-- xmonad-river follows.  The difference is that these are not pretending: each
-- one does what its X11 counterpart did, by a different route.  What is
-- reproduced is the /model/, not the implementation.
--
-- == Why this works at all
--
-- Two coincidences, and neither is luck:
--
-- * __A window-manager surface has an ObjectId, and so does a window.__ Under
--   river @Window@ /is/ @ObjectId@, and a @river_shell_surface_v1@ has one
--   too.  So 'createNewWindow' can hand back a real id and every
--   @Window@-typed signature in contrib survives untouched -- 'paintWindow',
--   @DecoWin@, all of it.  Which id belongs to which world is decided by the
--   registry below rather than by the type.
--
-- * __X11 drawing was always deferred.__ @drawImageString@ did not put pixels
--   on a screen; it queued a request on a connection that was flushed later.
--   Cairo insists drawing happen inside a live render context, which at first
--   looks incompatible with contrib's habit of painting a window in one
--   function and writing text into it in another.  It is not: operations are
--   accumulated per drawable and replayed inside 'renderWith' at commit.  That
--   is the same deferral X11 had, expressed differently.
--
-- The second point is what makes a compatible API possible.  Without it there
-- would be nowhere for @printStringXMF@ to draw.
--
-- == What is not reproduced
--
-- * Reading pixels back.  There is no @getImage@; nothing in contrib wants one.
-- * Event masks.  Accepted and ignored, as @clientMask@ already is.
-- * Errors surface at commit rather than at the call that caused them.

-- | An event mask.
--
-- Present only so that 'XMonad.Util.XUtils.createNewWindow' keeps its
-- signature.  River delivers exactly the events the management protocol
-- defines and there is nothing to select, so a value of this type carries no
-- information and is always ignored -- the same treatment @clientMask@ and
-- @rootMask@ get, and for the same reason.
type EventMask = Word64

-- | A point, as X11 spelled it.
--
-- Two coordinates; it ports without argument.  Defined here rather than in
-- xmonad-river because nothing but drawing code uses it, and xmonad itself has
-- no drawing code.

-- | Something that can be drawn on.  A window or an offscreen pixmap, as in

type Drawable = Window

-- | An offscreen drawable.  Used by "XMonad.Prompt" and
-- "XMonad.Layout.DecorationEx.Engine" to compose a frame before showing it, so
-- the user never sees a half-drawn one.
type Pixmap = Drawable

-- | A packed colour.
--
-- X11's @Pixel@ was an index into a colormap, resolved by the server.  Wayland
-- has neither, so this is the colour itself: @0xAARRGGBB@.  Every contrib
-- caller obtains one from a string via @stringToPixel@, so nothing notices the
-- difference.
-- Re-exported from XMonad rather than defined here, now that the backend has
-- it: a config reaches Pixel through @import XMonad@ on the X11 build, so it
-- has to be reachable the same way here, and two synonyms for the same thing
-- is one more than is useful.

--
-- Global for the same reason X11's were server-side: 'printStringXMF' and

-- in, and an id has to be resolvable from anywhere it can be passed.
