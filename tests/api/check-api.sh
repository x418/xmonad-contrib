# Usage: GHC="stack exec -- ghc" tests/api/check-api.sh
#
# The library must already be built.
#
# This checks the fork against its own record.  It does *not* compare it to
# upstream -- the two are deliberately different, because anything that cannot
# be ported faithfully is not exported at all.  That comparison is
# tests/api/check-subset.sh, which reads the upstream interface recorded in
# tests/api/upstream/ and requires every difference to be justified by name in
# unportable.txt.
#
# A mismatch here is one of two things, and telling them apart is the
# reviewer's job rather than this script's:
#
#   * an unintended API change -- a name lost or gained without meaning to;
#
#   * an intended one, usually a rebase onto xmonad HEAD that added an export.
#     Regenerate with dump-api.sh in the same commit, so the golden diff sits
#     next to the change that caused it.  For a fork whose purpose is tracking
#     upstream, that second case is the more valuable of the two: the golden
#     fails until this backend has grown whatever upstream just added, or
#     recorded in unportable.txt why it will not.
#
# The goldens are GHC-version-sensitive: :browse output is pretty-printed by
# the compiler, and successive releases have changed how some types render.
# Regenerate when bumping the resolver, and expect that diff to be noise.
